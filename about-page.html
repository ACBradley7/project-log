                    This website exists to hold myself accountable to finishing what I start.
                    Like many prgrammers, I find it very easy to jump from project to project without actually completing any of them.
                    By publicly displaying what I hope to accomplish, my goal is that I will better be able to stick to personal projects that I set for myself.

                    Hey everyone, my name is Drew Bradley.
                    I am a hobbist programmer and am attempting to make a career change into the field of software development by going back to school.
