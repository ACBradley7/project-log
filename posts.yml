        - "Finished reading through 'The C Programming Language' and completed a handful of exercises from the book. Very good. Very interesting. I still have much to learn about C."
        - "Attempted to apply C in various ways like writing a program to do Gaussian elimination and writing a program to handle vector operations. Pointers remain challenging."
        - "Began self-study of linear algebra through Heffron's course. Completed the first two chapters or so with associated practice problems."
        - "Learned the basics of assembly language. (A worthwhile distraction)"
        - "Gained a greater foundational understanding of computer architecture - e.g. how the machine code compiled by a program works at the physical level of being fetched by the CPU, the role of the ALU and other registers, how instructions are executed, what this means electronically for transitors and the implication on logic gates, and how input/output data is stored in dedicated chunks of memory to be read from.  (A very worthwhile distraction)"
        - "Made a quick visualization of Conway's Game of Life in JavaScript. (An enjoyable distraction)"

This format might be best served in via mobile where players can join random rooms."

Like many prgrammers, I find it very easy to jump from project to project without actually completing any of them. The end goal of publicly displaying what I hope to accomplish is to provide a sense of accountability for myself thereby motivating me to actually stick to my personal projects."
