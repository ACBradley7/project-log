        - "I was unable to continue holding myself away from CGFS so I decided to dive in and learned the basics of raytracing, lighting, and shadowing. At this point, I am mostly following along with his code line for line. I imagine I will have to re-implement this 2-4 more times in order to fully grasp what is going on."
        - "I generally feel much more comfortable with C and pointers now after a few weeks of feeling pretty confused."
        - "I realized that my knowledge of linear algebra is probably sufficient for what I need to do with graphical programming. The course by Hefferon was still pretty interesting, but I anticipate slowing down and maybe only learning one section a week or at some other similar pace."
        - "\"Finished\" Conway's Game of Life in JS for the web. I could/should still optimize it and maybe add some various additional features."

        - "Finished reading through 'The C Programming Language' and completed a handful of exercises from the book. Very good. Very interesting. I still have much to learn about C."

        - "Began self-study of linear algebra through Heffron's course. Completed the first two chapters or so with associated practice problems."
        - "Learned the basics of assembly language. (A worthwhile distraction)"
        - "Gained a greater foundational understanding of computer architecture - e.g. how the machine code compiled by a program works at the physical level of being fetched by the CPU, the role of the ALU and other registers, how instructions are executed, what this means electronically for transitors and the implication on logic gates, and how input/output data is stored in dedicated chunks of memory to be read from.  (A very worthwhile distraction)"
        - "Made a quick visualization of Conway's Game of Life in JavaScript. (An enjoyable distraction)"

This format might be best served in via mobile where players can join random rooms."
