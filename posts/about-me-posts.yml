      - paragraph: "This website exists to hold myself accountable to finishing what I start. Like many prgrammers, I find it very easy to jump from project to project without actually completing any of them. By publicly displaying what I hope to accomplish, my goal is that I will better be able to stick to personal projects that I set for myself."
